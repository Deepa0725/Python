# Conditional Statements in Python: if, elif, and else
'''In programming, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
Python uses if, elif, and else statements to allow your program to make decisions.'''

# 1. The if Statement
'''The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is True, the block of code under the if statement is executed.'''

# Syntax:
'''if condition:
'''    # Code block to execute if the condition is True


# Example1:
'''Let's say we want to check if it's time for dinner (assuming dinner time is 8 PM).
'''

time = 20  # 20 represents 8 PM in 24-hour format
if time == 20:
    print("It's time for dinner!")
