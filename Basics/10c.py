# Practice Programs

# 1.Basic Counting with while Loop:
'''Write a program that counts from 1 to 10 using a while loop.'''

i = 0

while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    
# OUTPUT:
'''
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
'''

# 2. Odd Numbers Printer:
'''Create a program that prints all odd numbers between 1 and 20 using a while loop.'''

i = 0
 
while i <= 20:
    if i%2 != 0:
        print(i)
    i += 1

# OUTPUT:
'''
1
3
5
7
9
11
